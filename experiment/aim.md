To understand and demonstrate the systematic transformation of Nondeterministic Finite Automata into equivalent Regular Expressions through the state elimination algorithm. Students will learn to visualize and execute the step-by-step process of removing intermediate states while preserving language recognition capabilities, observing how state-based visual representations convert into concise textual regex patterns. Through the exploration of state elimination sequences, students will gain practical experience in understanding how automata-based recognition mechanisms and pattern-based expressions represent dual paradigms for regular language processing, reinforcing the fundamental equivalence between finite automata and regular expressions in computational theory.
